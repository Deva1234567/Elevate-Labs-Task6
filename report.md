# Task 6: Password Strength Evaluation Report

## Introduction
This report documents the process of creating and testing passwords of varying complexity, evaluating their strength using an online tool, and summarizing best practices for password security.

## Passwords Tested
I created five passwords with different levels of complexity and tested them on [Password Meter](https://www.passwordmeter.com/). Below are the passwords (sanitized for security), test results, and feedback:

1. **Password 1**: `pass123`
   - **Strength Score**: 20% (Very Weak)
   - **Feedback**: Too short, lacks uppercase letters and symbols.
   - **Screenshot**: `screenshot1.png`

2. **Password 2**: `P@ssw0rd2023`
   - **Strength Score**: 60% (Medium)
   - **Feedback**: Decent length, includes symbols and numbers, but predictable pattern.
   - **Screenshot**: `screenshot2.png`

3. **Password 3**: `Tr0ub4dor&3xplor3r`
   - **Strength Score**: 85% (Strong)
   - **Feedback**: Good length and character mix, but could be longer.
   - **Screenshot**: `screenshot3.png`

4. **Password 4**: `BlueSky!River9Moon#`
   - **Strength Score**: 92% (Very Strong)
   - **Feedback**: Excellent passphrase with diverse characters.
   - **Screenshot**: `screenshot4.png`

5. **Password 5**: `9k#Qz!mP2v&L8x@Rw5`
   - **Strength Score**: 98% (Very Strong)
   - **Feedback**: Optimal length and randomness, highly secure.

## Password Attacks
- **Brute Force Attack**: Attempts every possible character combination. Longer passwords increase the time required exponentially.
- **Dictionary Attack**: Uses a list of common words/phrases. Complex passwords and passphrases avoid dictionary words, making these attacks less effective.

## Best Practices for Strong Passwords
1. Use at least 12-16 characters.
2. Include uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special symbols.
3. Avoid common words, phrases, or personal information.
4. Use passphrases for memorability (e.g., `HorseBatteryStaple9!`).
5. Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) for added security.
6. Use a password manager to generate and store complex passwords.
7. Never reuse passwords across different sites.

## Interview Questions
1. **What makes a password strong?**
   A strong password is long (12+ characters), uses a mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols, and avoids predictable patterns or personal info.

2. **What are common password attacks?**
   - Brute Force: Tries all possible combinations.
   - Dictionary Attack: Uses a list of common words/phrases.

3. **Why is password length important?**
   Longer passwords increase the number of possible combinations, making brute force attacks computationally expensive.

4. **What is a dictionary attack?**
   A dictionary attack uses a precompiled list of common words, phrases, or leaked passwords to guess a password.

5. **What is multi-factor authentication?**
   MFA requires multiple verification methods (e.g., password + SMS code or biometric) to authenticate a user.

6. **How do password managers help?**
   Password managers generate, store, and autofill complex passwords, reducing the risk of reuse or weak passwords.

7. **What are passphrases?**
   Passphrases are long passwords made of multiple random words (e.g., `CloudRiver!Moon9Star`), combining security and memorability.

8. **What are common mistakes in password creation?**
   - Using short passwords.
   - Including personal info (e.g., name, birthdate).
   - Reusing passwords across sites.
   - Using predictable patterns (e.g., "1234", "qwerty").

## Conclusion
Password length and complexity significantly impact security. Passphrases and password managers are effective tools for creating and managing strong passwords. Multi-factor authentication adds an extra layer of protection against attacks like brute force and dictionary attacks.
