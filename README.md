# Cybersecurity Internship Task 6: Password Strength Evaluation

## Objective
This task involves creating passwords of varying complexity, testing their strength using an online tool, and documenting best practices for password security.

## Approach
1. Created five passwords with different lengths and character types.
2. Tested each password using [Password Meter](https://www.passwordmeter.com/).
3. Recorded strength scores and feedback.
4. Researched common password attacks (brute force, dictionary).
5. Summarized best practices and answered interview questions.

## Files
- `report.md`: Detailed report with password test results, screenshots, and security insights.
- `screenshot1.png`, `screenshot2.png`, etc.: Screenshots of password strength test results.

## Key Findings
- Longer passwords (12+ characters) with mixed character types are significantly stronger.
- Passphrases are effective for balancing security and memorability.
- Password managers and multi-factor authentication enhance security.
